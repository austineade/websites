3) Install FFPMEG

*IMPORTANT*: FFMPEG helper being activated by default in the install profile, a wrong configuration of FFMPEG will result in problems on your Filmforge install.

FFMPEG can be downloaded from the site: http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu

In order to use the FFMPEG helper you need to install FFMPEG on your server. The default path is '/usr/bin/ffmpeg' but you can change it in the filmforge.profile file by setting the 'video_ffmpeg_helper_ffmpeg_path' variable: variable_set('video_ffmpeg_helper_ffmpeg_path', '/path/to/ffmpeg');

4) Install Flow Player

Flow Player can be downloaded from the site: http://flowplayer.org

Place the file ?FlowPlayer.swf at the website's root or, alternatively, set the path to the file by changing the variable 'video_flvplayerloader' in the filmforge.profile file. variable_set('video_flvplayerloader', 'path/to/FlowPlayer.swf');

The variable 'video_flvplayerloader_fullscreen' needs to be set to the URL pointing to the fullscreen.js file, available as part of the ?FlowPlayer package. variable_set('video_flvplayerloader_fullscreen', 'http://myfilmforgesite.net/fullscreen.js');

5) Run install profile

Run the install.php script with the filmforge profile ie. http;//myfilmforgesite.net/install.php?profile=filmforge
