                  <p>2. After selecting the ads you would like to see, Contact us now to receive a FREE video featuring your selection.</p>

                  <p>4. After you make your final selection, we'll send you our standard lease agreement.</p>
                  <p>5. If you want to make your own edits to the ad, we’ll send you the beta master.</p>
