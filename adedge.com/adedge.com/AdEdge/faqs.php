From  start-ups that can’t afford agency creative but want high-quality ads,  to established small to mid-size businesses that don’t have their own  agencies, to large companies that have good agencies but want to test  ideas quickly. Our clients range from mom-and-pop furniture stores to  multi-million dollar health care networks. </p>

                          <p>Immediately! We’ll send you an  original beta master of the commercial upon our receipt of your signed  license agreement and payment. If we customize your ad, you can be on  the air as soon as 7 business days from our receipt of your artwork and  scripts.</p>

                        <dd>
                          <p>No. AdEdge handles everything — we  contact all parties and pay them directly. To keep it simple for you,  these costs are built into your leasing fee. </p>

                        <dd>
                          <p>Our agreement typically allows advertisers to use the ads for six-month or one-year periods in the markets they choose.</p>

                        <dd>
                          <p>Absolutely not. For the commercial you lease, we guarantee that you will be the exclusive user in your market.</p>

                        <dd>
                          <p>That’s easy: They make money. We  pay the ad’s original creators handsome royalties whenever their ad is  leased. And hey, if you have great advertising, let us know! You could  have a new revenue stream in place within weeks.</p>

                        <dd>
                          <p>Most of the ads in our library cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce. Yet you pay <strong>as little as 5%</strong> of the original production cost. That’s right — 5%! Some of our ads  cost as little as $1,500 for a six-month lease. This savings allows you  to spend your ad dollars on media, while your competitors spend their  money on commercial production!</p>

                          <p>Our ads are easily customized for  your business. A new voiceover is recorded with your marketing message,  on-screen text is added, and your logo and contact information are  inserted. Since the ads available to you have never run in your market  before, it will appear to viewers that this network-quality ad was  originally designed and produced for you. </p>

                          <p>AdEdge works with all clients on a  completely confidential basis. Your competitors should have no clue  about your new campaign before you launch it. And we’d never use your  name in our marketing materials without receiving prior permission.</p>

                          <p>If the campaign you like also  originally included print and/or radio, we’ll create customized  versions of these media for you as well. And if no print or radio  exists, we can create them for you. </p>
