--------------
Finally got round to some more updates on Flashnode! Added ability to accept
flv and mp3 files as upload. These are passed to SWFTools for rendering using
the selected player settings.

Fixed a bug in flashnode_delete that meant flash files weren't deleted when
the parent node was deleted.

4 June 2007
-----------
SWFTools is now available as an official release. Final tweaks to get
flashnode ready for next release. As final test it is now uploaded and
running on stuartandnicola.com!

27 May 2007
-----------
Added a maximum displayed height / maximum displayed width setting so that
the admin can limit the displayed height / width of flash content to
prevent page layouts being broken. Movies that are smaller than the limits
are displayed as normal - movies that are larger are scaled down as needed.
The limits are applied during the display routine, so will be applied to
content inserted via the macro format too. The feature can be switched off
by setting a limit value of zero. This feature added in response to a user
request.

18 May 2007
-----------
Added base as a parameter to allow migration of content. base defaults to
the correct path to access the default files directory, but can be
over-ridden on a node by node basis if required.

16 May 2007
-----------
Various bug fixes addressed.
Comments improved to make code easier to understand (hopefully!)
flashnode_content updated so that if called without a filter format it will
assume FILTER_FORMAT_DEFAULT (to make calling from PHP easier)

8 May 2007
----------
As flash node now has the option to use user provided substitution text the
macro filter must process the markup through the filters for the node. When
displaying flash in its own node this happens as part of flash_view, but the
macro returns markup via a different method. We must force the markup check
as we don't know if the flash macro is being called first or last. The call
to hook_filter provides the appropriate format as a parameter, so we use this
to run check_markup(). This means that the substitution content is filtered
using the input format that applies to the node where the flash is being
rendered, not the parent node where the original file is stored!

6 May 2007
----------
Installer written that (hopefully) handles migration from flash to flashnode.
Installation steps are to disable the old flash module in Drupal. Probably next
is best to delete the folder. Then upload flashnode and activate it. Upon
installation it should run an update routine that migrates flash to flashnode.
The installer proved a little tricky to write since Drupal treats the set up as
a first time install of the module, and so the update routines don't run, so
we have to force it. Only tested on MySQL as that is my system, but should work
on both...

5 May 2007
----------
Major overhaul of basic code - there were a number of bugs in the way the
upload and preview code was working that meant resetting to defaults after
previewing was not working correctly. A major headache to fix, but think it
is ok now.

1 May 2007
----------
Migration towards SWFTools integration underway!

21 April 2007
-------------
Slight change to _flash_check_settings() as module is being prepared for
addition to Drupal repository and ufo.js cannot be included. check_settings
will now check for presence of ufo.js, warn if it is not found, and offer a
link the zip file.

Where module name is displayed to end user it has been changed to Flash node
to bring it in line with the Drupal project name. Internally it is still
just flash, but starts migration toward correct project name. Next release
will be flashnode both externally and internally.

UPDATE.txt instructions added for users coming from the original direct
download version of the module. Updating is easiest if the old module is
removed first. No content is lost doing it this way!

20 April 2007
-------------
Bug fix: updating a flash node did not reset the filter cache, so nodes that use
flash macros did not update to reflect new content. Thanks to Andreas Hennig for
reporting this one!

06 April 2007
-------------
Forgot to amend flash.install so it didn't create fid in the first place! Fixed.

04 April 2007
-------------
Discovered that the update routine didn't add the fid column, but then realised
fid isn't actually needed, so the update is to drop it if it exists!

16 March 2007
-------------
Some minor changes to the string formatting, to make better use of t('')

24 February 2007
----------------
First version for Drupal 5.x!
Main change is to the code to use the new administration callback.
Otherwise module is much as it was before!
I guess this makes it version 5.x-1.0

12 December 2006
----------------
Flash field was not required so it was possible to submit a node without having
a flash file linked to it. A file must now be given before you can submit node.
Flash field renamed to Flash file to make it clearer what is needed.
Flash field had a a weight of -3 which meant it rose to the top when editing -
weighting removed so it appears in main flash area now.

06 December 2006
----------------
Some minor changes and extra comments.
Nothing significant.
Version number changed to 4.7.x.1.1 to bring in line with Drupal module scheme.

28 November 2006
----------------
First version for Drupal 4.7!
All functionality of original module retained.
.install written to automate creation of {flash} table in the database.
Ready for release for testing (I think!)


26 April 2006
-------------
Version 1.4
Filter added to allow Flash to be re-used in other nodes.
Filter allows various scaling methods to re-size flash content.


18 April 2006
-------------
Code tidied up further, and validation routine made neater.
Some minor changes to _load.
Probably ready for this to be released and tested fully!


18 April 2006
-------------
Some serious debugging as a few glitches became apparent!
Also made it so if version or build are left blank they will reset to the defaults automatically.
Error handling made neater so if invalid file loaded other errors should be skipped.


17 April 2006
-------------
Now uses image_get_info to try and determine the flash movie size.
If height and width are left blank on the submission form then if the settings can be obtained from the Flash file then they will be used.
Changed the configuration page to allow this too, by allowing empty height and width settings.
Tries to check the file type was valid. If invalid deletes the uploaded file and sets an error. Cannot submit until a valid upload is given. Done to try and avoid hangs by accidentally loading the wrong type of file!
Changed text area title to Body.


17 April 2006
-------------
Tidied up a lot, and removed redundant image.module elements.
All flash data combined in $node->flash for ease of understanding.
Remove fid from {flash} table - no longer needed.


16 April 2006
-------------
First version for Drupal 4.6
