UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF FLASH / FLASHNODE

If you have previously used any version of flash.module or flashnode please
please follow the instructions below to install the SWFTools version.

0! Back up your existing flash table (just in case!)

1. Disable your current flash module at Administer>Site building>Modules

2. Remove the old flash.module directory (modules/flash unless you chose to
   call the directory something different!)

3. Download and install SWFTools.

4. Upload the new flashnode directory to your modules directory.

5. Enable Flashnode at Administer > Site building > Modules

Upon installation flashnode will migrate your existing flash tables to the
new schema. It will also update any node entries that use flash macros. Note
that with Flashnode 5.2 the macro format has changed from [flash|nid=nn] to
[flashnode|nid=nn]. This is necessary to (a) align the macro name with the
module name, but also to avoid a possible future clash with flash_filter - it
also uses macros by the name [flash]

Note that migration is a one way process. Once you have installed Flash node
5.2 or later you cannot automatically revert to Flash node 5.1.

The module is now installed. Your content will display as normal. If you
enabled the flash filter then this should have remained active for input
formats you previously chose, and will be active for existing content.

Note: you can choose the insertion method that SWFTools will use at
Administer > SWFTools > Embedding settings > JavaScript embedding. If you are
using flash macros then you must also check 'All pages' to ensure that the
required script files are available to all pages.
